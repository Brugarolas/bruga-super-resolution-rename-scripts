The Author is well aware that the last sentence may sound a bit controversial, however, he wants you to know that he is a reasonable person and want to remind you that commercial activities are not prohibited: you must just ask him for consent. The compensations the Author may ask you in return are not necessarily monetary ones, but to collaborate together in the development of the Software, free use or your software-as-a-service, promotion of his Software, or most likely nothing at all.
This Software, any modification of it or any derivate of it must conserve this original License (PROSL) and not even the original Author is entitled to negotiate or make any kind of deal that states the opposite.
Any kind of deal with the original Author does not mean under any circunstance that this Software may be sold, monetized, retristributed or used under a different license; does not mean neither that the other party is exempt of enforcing this license, the rights it guarantees to users and the restrictions it imposes to certain entities or activities; nor gives it the right to the other party to negotiate about the use, sell, redistribution, monetization, or modification of this Software with any third parties without the original Author express consent.

The Author is aware that the last sentence is a bit vague and open to interpretation, however, if you felt uncomfortable or felt referented while reading it, there is a high change that you are part of the list and you should reconsider your values.

7. Universality:
This license is meant to be universally applicable, however it was written in a specific european country jurisdiction context by someone whose native language is not English, so it is possible that some aspects are not clear enough or that they conflict with any local, state, national or federal laws of some other countries.
